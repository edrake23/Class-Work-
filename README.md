#Hello Comrades

This is My First Repository on GitHub

I'm very new to the world of Data Science and I'm driven by intellectual curiousity, solving pressing issues of our time, and world domination. 

Joking on the world domination part (kinda). 

I hope to learn alot, or at the very least keep up and not make a fool of myself. Please reach out and welcome me into your community with open arms!
